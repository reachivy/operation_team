11,14," Part 2:) Now that I’ve received an offer from durham university, its better that i reply back with my decision soon so that i get a good college, if I’m to go to Durham. But, till now Kings has not replied back with any decision on my app. so I was wondering if i get an offer from Kings as well, then which one should i go for ? Please forward this to the counsellors and the team which has worked with me! There are a few questions and things on my mind which i would like to get advice on, 
for example, 

 i want to know that because kings is located in central london, which means i would gain more experience being in the city as compared to being at Durham, so how much does that make a difference in one’s masters? 

Also, the kind of course and study which would be my main focus, i have researched on both the college’s respective site ( of MA in international relations and politics ) , and i feel that durham is offering a better course.. But i would really like if the counsellors can go on their site and just check please. 

And lastly, it is important that i choose the university which has more academic reputation and standing. What i know is Kings has a name because of being in central london, but im not sure whether its really that good for masters. Whereas, Durham seems to be more academically prestigious and reputed. So I would like to know the counsellors response too, on the reputation of the colleges. ","Congratulations on Durham! 

 

In the offer letter Durham would have provided you with a date/deadline by which you need to reply.  I would recommend you wait at least a week before that deadline to accept the offer or decline the offer.  

With regards to Kings I recommend you send them an update email, just providing a 2-3 points on what has changed/improved since you applied and that you are looking forward to hearing back from them.  If they need any other information, you are happy to provide that. 

In terms of ranking both globally and for your program, King's has a stronger reputation. 

To decide between the two options - I strongly recommend you look at 3 things: 

1) The class profile - are you going to be with a peer group you see yourself learning from both in the long term and short term? 

2) Curriculum - is the class material aligning with your goals and expectations? 

3) Career prospects - the college needs to allow you to gain employment in your company / field / role of preference. 

To find this information, look at the college website, like/follow them on social media, read their student blogs and connect with students and alumni from these colleges.  LinkedIn profiles of graduates will also give you great insight. ",deadline | class profile | curriculum | outcomes
11,15,Choosing between UK and USA schools?,"UK vs USA - the educational system and methodology is completely different.  our preference is for the USA as you gain a more holistic approach to education, and flexibility to explore your academic options for deciding.

You will find a vast difference in the curriculum structure. ",UK schools | USA schools | curriculum structure | class profile | job options
11,16,How do I choose a first-year pathway at UC Berkeley?,"Choosing a first year pathway when you enrol at UC Beerkeley. Choosing the traditional pathway or the fall program for freshman pathway - You can’t go wrong with either path but
